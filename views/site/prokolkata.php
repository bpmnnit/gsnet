                        <p class="text-justify"><strong>Preamble:</strong> RCC, Kolkata is the premier Seismic Data Processing Centre that caters to the exploratory needs  of MBA Basin consisting of Bengal-Purnea, Mahanadi and Andaman area both onland and offshore. To meet the growing need of seismic data processing and interpretation, Regional Computer Centre(RCC), Kolkata was established in September, 1988 at P-32 Transport Depot Road, Majerhat, Kolkata-700088, with a Soviet EC-1061 mainframe computer system with main peripherals from BASF, West Germany and Array processor from lzotimtex, Bulgaria, a T-32 Plotting system from Geosource, USA and INGOS-1M interactive interpretation system from USSR.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">RCC, Kolkata always keeps a closet rack of technological advances in the industry and upgrades with the latest technology to meet its customer requirements to enhance the professional competence and upgraded its hardware and software infrastructure time to time.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">During 1991-92 VAX 3200 was procured for SIDIS-IIWS. IIWS with SUNSS-2, SS-5, SUN Blade 1000 and SUN Ultra-60 systems were commissioned and software used were OpenWorks, SeisWorks 2D/3D StratWorks, PetroWorks Open Vision etc. Interactive Processing System(IPS) was installed in 1997 with SUN Ultra II, SUN Blade 1000, SUN Ultra 80 and SUN E4500 Server and Promax 2D/3D, VSP, MVA Zeh software. Data Archival System(DAS) was installed in 1999 with SUN Ultra system and RAM, IDS, M5U, Petro Vision, Rapport software.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">RCC, Kolkata had acquired SGI Altix 3700 Bx2 (32 CPU) Server with 10TB EMC DMX 1000 Storage, IBM Workstations, 3590 and LTO-1 &amp; LTO-2 Tape Drives in 2005 software package from M/S Paradigm for seismic Data processing Software Suite including Emerson make Precision AC &amp; 2x60 KVA UPS systems.</p>

                        <p class="text-justify">In May, 2015 the office premises of RCC, Kolkata has been relocated from P-32 Transport Depot Road, Majerhat, Kolkata -700088 to Technopolis, Saltlake, Sector-V, Kolkata -700091. The old hardware has been phased out and new Computer systems have been installed. The Systems include DELL PowerEdge R920 Server, Ten Nos. of DELL Precision T7610 Workstations, IBM 3592 Tape Drives (installed in 2014), LTO-6 tape drive (installed in 2016) alongwith existing 3590, LTO2, LTO-3 Tape Drives. The Epos3 Software of M/S Paradigm Geophysical B.V. has been upgraded to Paradigm Processing Software Suite-14. The same system is also being used for Data Archival System with in-house developed Web based Record maintenance software. In the June, 2017 Paradigm software suite has been upgraded to its latest version-17.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">Presently, RCC Kolkata caters to the exploratory needs of the MBA Basin by way of seismic data processing in Time and Depth domain Processing including 2D, 3D, AVO etc . The RCC Data Centre operates on 24 x 7 basis to meet the needs of MBA Basin. In addition to the need of seismic data processing for MBA basin, RCC, Kolkata is also processing the data pertaining to other basins of India viz. KG, Cauvery & Western Offshore Basin, Mumbai as per the requirement.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">During April, 2017 RCC changed it's name to Processing Centre.</p>
