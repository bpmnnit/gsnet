                        <p class="text-justify"><strong>RCC Jorhat</strong> is the premier Seismic Data processing hub that caters to the North-Eastern part of India and particular to Assam and Assam-Arakan Basin (The Upper Assam Shelf also called NAS, Lower Assam Shelf also known as SAS and the Fold Belts). It was felt that the data acquired in the region should be processed and quality checked in the region itself. That is how RCC (Jorhat) came into existence in 1988-89. The centre is also a <strong>9001:2008 QMS</strong> and <strong>27001:2013 ISMS Certified.</strong></p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Almost all data in old tapes (round reels, 359x, DAT and other media) have been successfully archived onto Disk based storage. Stringent quality check and validation is carried out in this mammoth exercise.</li>
                            <li>All Operational Reports/Datasheets/Observer Reports and other documents are also scanned and archived after QC onto disk successfully.</li>
                            <li>The Digital Archival System is currently being re-designed to cater for accelerating the process of data submission from fields as well as issue on request by the processors.</li>
                            <li>This has greatly reduced man-hour, time as well as the dependency on legacy and obsolete archival systems.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Road Ahead</h4>
                        <p class="text-justify">Overhauling of the existing Hardware is under process with active co-ordination from all other Processing Centres across ONGC. A more powerful and efficient cluster is under procurement from MAP – ONGC, Dehradun. With the accelerating development in the Application G&G Software suites it is indeed necessary for this exercise to keep abreast with the latest Hardware and computing power available in the present day. The new Hardware and Application promises better performance, Higher Return on Investment (ROI), Lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) and last but not the least – a greener planet in the form of lesser carbon foot-print.</p>
